## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### PROJECT: "PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER"

### OBJECTIVE: 
To develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users. Algorithms to analyse factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness must be implemented.


### Key activities:
- **reading the password:** The program starts by prompting the user to enter their password. Then it is read and stored in a character array ("password")
- **criteria checks:** Multiple functions are implemented by the program to check various criteria of the password like 'hasUppercase(const char *password)', 'hasDigit(const char *password)', etc.
- **password strength is assessed:** The function 'assessPasswordStrength( const char *password)': The length of the password is calculated and then it is evaluated against various criteria using the helper functions. The score is calculated on the basis of how many criteria the password meets.
- **feedback generation:** Specific feedback is provided to the user on how to improve their password in case it fails to meet the criteria.



### Technologies used: 
- **C Programming**
- **VSS Code**
